# Express.js: Missing Error Handling in User Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that lacks proper handling for database errors and the scenario where a user is not found.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code is missing error handling for database errors and the case where a user does not exist.  This results in potentially unhelpful error messages (or crashes) for clients.  Proper error handling is crucial for creating robust and reliable applications.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly handling potential errors.  It checks for database errors and the case where the user is not found, sending appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages to the client.
